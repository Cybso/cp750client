CP750 Volume Client
===================

This is a simple python based client that implements a frontend
to control the volume and audio source controls of a Dolby CP750
Cinema Sound Processor.

## Project State

I've just started this project to create a touchscreen based
remote control for our local cinema. At the moment this is
nothing more than a text based interface to communicate with
the CP750 - and up to the moment it's only tested against the
simulator I've created in 'server.py'. I'm gonna test it against
the real processor within the next days.
